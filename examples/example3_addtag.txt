script: example1_addtag.py

description:
this program loads the converted ruleset structure, and searches the rules
what contains 'tag:OWASP_CRS'. If the rule founded, then inserts a new tag
with value: 'tag:OWASP_CRS_NEW'.

transformation:

old data:
SecRule REQUEST_BODY "@rx foo" \
    "id:0001, \
    t:none, \
    tag:OWASP_CRS"

new data:
SecRule REQUEST_BODY "@rx foo" \
    "id:0001, \
    t:none, \
    tag:OWASP_CRS_NEW, \
    tag:OWASP_CRS"

Note, that this example shows how can you modify a part of your ruleset
depending of context. Here, we searched only one action (tag) with only one
value (OWASP_CRS), nothing more.

Use:
you have to run this script with argument YAML structured file. The script
will save a copy of the given input. To see the differences, you have to
write back the structure with crs_write.py.
